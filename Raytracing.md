# Ray Tracing experimentation
This will have things that I have learned and need to know in order to write some code 
to create ray traced images

**Normailzing a vector:**
To normalize a vector, therefore, is to take a vector of any length and, keeping 
it pointing in the same direction, change its length to 1, turning it into what 
is called a unit vector. Since it describes a vector's direction without regard 
to its length, it's useful to have the unit vector readily accessible.
